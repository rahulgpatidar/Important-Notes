Selenium Grid Architecture:
Selenium Grid has a Hub and Node Architecture.

The Hub:

The hub is the central point where you load your tests.
There should only be one hub in a grid.

The Nodes:

Nodes are the Selenium instances that will execute the tests that you loaded on the hub.

~~~ for HUB, use this command:

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.13.0.jar -role hub

~~~ for Node, use this command:

java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="./SeleniumPractice/Drivers/chromedriver.exe" -jar selenium-server-standalone-3.13.0.jar -role node -hub http://192.168.0.102:4444/grid/register
