Question on WebDriver wait statement  
22. What is Synchronization
It is a mechanism which involves more than one components to work parallel with Each other.

Generally in Test Automation, we have two components
1. Application Under Test
2. Test Automation Tool.

Both these components will have their own speed. We should write our scripts in such a way that both the components should move with same and desired speed, so that we will not encounter "Element Not Found" errors which will consume time again in debugging.

Synchronization can be classified into two categories:

1. Unconditional 
2. Conditional Synchronization

Unconditional :
In this we just specify timeout value only. We will make the tool to wait until certain amount of time and then proceed further.

Examples: Wait() and Thread.Sleep();

The main disadvantage for the above statements are, there is a chance of unnecessary waiting time even though the application is ready.

The advantages are like in a situation where we interact for third party systems like interfaces, it is not possible to write a condition or check for a condition. Here in this situations, we have to make the application to wait for certain amount of time by specifying the timeout value.

Conditional Synchronization:

We specify a condition along with timeout value, so that tool waits to check for the condition and then come out if nothing happens.

It is very important to set the timeout value in conditional synchronization, because the tool should proceed further instead of making the tool to wait for a particular condition to satisfy.

TestNG interview Questions
64. What is TestNG , why it is required 
        Ans :  Unit testing framework Tool , used for parallel , grouping , parallel execution , Assertion , HTML    mREport

65. With OUT TESTNG , what all the challenges you faced 
 

66. Why TestNG , Why not JUNIT
1. Additional annotation 
2. HTMl reporting
3. Grouping
4. Parameterziation
5. Support both java , .net
6. Parallel execution
67. What is Annotation, explain all the annotation with real time EG:
      @beforeClass           // global config like Launch browser
      @AfterClass             // close browser
     @beforeMethod      //login
    @AfterMEthod          //logout 
     @test

//actual test script

68. What is the use @beforeTest , @afterTest in testing
                              @BeforTest will be executed , Before executing all the <Classes> available with Test-Runner 
                      RealTime useage : in case of cross browser parallel execution , we do use before test annotation to set the browser
  

69. What is the use @beforeSuite , @afterSuite in testing
70. Explain the hierarchy of testNG annotation 
@beforeSuite
@beforeTest
@beforeClass
@beforeMethod
@test
71. What is batch execution,& how to achieve batch execution
Collection multiple test is called batch , execute multiple through testing.xml
72. Write Syntax of Xml
         <suite>
                  <test>
                        <classes>
                            <class>

73. What is grouping execution,& how to achieve group execution

74. What is parallel execution, & how to achieve parallel execution

75. How to achieve CROSS browser testing using Selenium
     @parameter

76. How to disable the testing test scripts
           @test(enabled=false)
77. How to execute same test with multiple times
          @test(invocation count= 10)
78. What is ASSERTION, & how many assertion you used in real-time selenium testscripts , explain with real time EG
     Assert.assertEquals(“actcomNAme”, “expComNAme”)
     Assert.assertTrute(logoStatus)

79. What is @parameter annotation in testNG , how to send parameter to testNG test

80. How to execute same test with multiple data
@dataprrovider

81. What is the @Listner annotation in TestNG

82. Difference between testNG-Listner & webdriver Listner

    testNG Lis : ITestListner
WebDriver List : EventFiringWebDriver
52  How to execute only failed test only , when batch execution is Done
          After the batch execution “refresh the folder” than automatically we get testing-falied.xml (inside test-output), just the that xml file
83. How to execute dependent test-Scripts
2 ways
 Priority
dependencies
84. How to execute failed  test multiple times
  ITestREtry
85. When ever we get build which test-scripts , you will execute first
Using grouping concept , we will execute smokeTest first
