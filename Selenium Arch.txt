in selenium client library-everything is availble in the form of API(alert api, sendkey api, get api,navigate api..etc)

calling will happen thorugh -REST web services-: call-GET/POST/DELETE

will write our code in java/ruby/c#..in eclipse (internally all the commands are available in the form of APIs)- will send all the request throgh JSON wire protocol over HTTP client - this JSON will send request to server(chrome server/gecho/ie server)- this will send to real browser- and if request is valid it will respond with 200 OK and if request in not valid it will send another responce like 400/500 something and this will go to the server driver-JSON-eclipse and it will convert to readable message in console

Selenium send request(API) to browser in the form of JSON payload

API (Application programing interface)-everything will available in the form of JARs(Like- selenium jars/Aapche POI jars/Cucumber jars)-so what exactly will do will use these jars will import these jars in our system and will use (will call thier methods and use)
ex- Calculator- will use sum/division methods -by importing thier jars
one system will interact with other with JSON/XML (suppose one is written in JAVA and other is in C#, so they dont undersatnd each other tht is why JSON comes into the picture)
Open source api- Selenium/Apache poi- we can take the source code and also we can change and create our own APIs
Licenced API- we can use only but not change

WIndow- licenced
Linux-open source- we can create LINUX

Webservices- will call APIs but over the internet (in the form of JSON)- will send the request in the form of JSON (will enter in the UI but internally it will convert into JSON format) -request will go throgh network and send responce (in the form of JSON)
