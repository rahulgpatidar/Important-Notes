What is Docker ?

Docker is the world’s leading software container platform

Docker makes the process of application deployment very easy and efficient and resolves a lot of issues related to deploying applications

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run applications by using containers

Docker gives you a standard way of packaging your application with all its dependencies in a container

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. 

Understand Docker with analogy of the Shipping industry

How a real world problem was resolved using containers


Basic
: docker version
: docker -v
: docker infod
: docker --help
: docker login
————————————
Images
: docker images
: docker pull
: docker rmi
————————————
Containers
: docker ps
: docker run
: docker start
: docker stop
————————————
System
: docker stats
: docker system df
: docker system prune




What are Images
Docker Images are templates used to create Docker containers
Container is a running instance of image

Where are Images Stored
Registries (e.g. docker hub)
Can be stored locally or remote

: docker images --help
: docker pull image
: docker images
: docker images -q
: docker images -f “dangling=false”
: docker images -f “dangling=false” -q

: docker run image
: docker rmi image
: docker rmi -f image

: docker inspect
: docker history imageName














What are Containers:
Containers are running instances of Docker Images


COMMANDS
: docker ps
: docker run ImageName
: docker start ContainerName/ID
: docker stop ContainerName/ID

: docker pause ContainerName/ID
: docker unpause  ContainerName/ID

: docker top ContainerName/ID
: docker stats ContainerName/ID

: docker attach ContainerName/ID

: docker kill ContainerName/ID
: docker rm ContainerName/ID

: docker history ImageName/ID

Notes


A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.

Features of Containers:

Are lightweight

Fewer resources are used

Booting of containers is very fast

Can start, stop, kill, remove containers easily and quickly

Operating System resources can be shared within Docker



Containers run on the same machine sharing the same Operating system Kernel, this makes it faster

You can use the command
docker container create
to create a container in stopped state
